    <p class="font1">You reach the Bunker where the men are trapped.  "Hey! Can you hear me?!" you shout through the Bunker's busted door.
    <br>"Yes! Help us get out, we can't seem to open the door.  There's 5 of us trapped in here!"
    <br>"Stand back!" yells Briggs.  With all his brute strength he kicks the door down.  The trapped men come out one by one.  You can see the exhaustion in their eyes.
    <br>"Alright boys, were getting you out of here.  Follow me North-West away from the battle" commands Briggs.  You take the rear and make your way back to where you started.
    <p class="font1">Suddenly, an enemy mortar lands several feet to your right.  You have a split second to react.</p>
    <p class="font2">Find cover and save yourself or jump on the mortar and save your fellow soldiers?</p>
