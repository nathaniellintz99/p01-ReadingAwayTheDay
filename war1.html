    <p class="font1">You retreat to your nook and sit down in your cozy beanbag chair.  You open up the book to the halfway mark, so you won't know what's going on.  You grin "That's half the fun!".  You shove your face into the pages and <b><i>WOOSH!</i></b>  The lights go out and you can't see a thing.  <b><i>BAM!</i></b>  A bright light blinds you and you cower.</p>
    <p class="font1"><b>"Did you hear me Maggot!?"</b></p>
    <p class="font1">You look up and towering above you is a built, mean-looking solider with a patch saying "Lieutenant Briggs".  You're in the dirt in a smokey war torn field.  All you can see are bunkers, soldiers and smoke every which way.  You glance back at the man and notice he has a United State's military officer uniform.  "He can't be too bad if he's on our side, right?".  You quickly get up before he can yell again.</p>
    <p class="font1">"Follow my lead to that bunker where those soliders are trapped. Now!".  He turns around and begins making his way to the bunker.
    <p class="font2">Follow the Lieutenant Brigg's orders or abandon your platoon?</p>
