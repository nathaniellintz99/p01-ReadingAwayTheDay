    <p class="font1">"Get Cover!" you scream as you dive into a small hole and cover your ears.</p>
    <p class="font1"><i><b>BOOM!</b></i> Fire and shrapnel fly above you.  Then silence.</p>
    <p class="font1">You peep out of your whole and fire and smoke blinds you.  Your heart sinks; it looks like no one else survived the explosion.<br>"Anyone there!?" you yell.  A few seconds pass by, then-<br>"Here!".  One of the soldiers from the bunker survived. <br>"Shit!  We're the only ones that made it." You both take a moment of silence for your fallen soldiers.<br>"Okay, let's get out of here before another mortar comes our way!"</p>
    <p class="font1">It's been hours since you left the warzone and you still haven't reached camp.  It's getting dark and you realize you can end the story with the gun you're carrying.</p>
    <p class="font2">Turn East and look for your camp or give up hope with your gun?</p>
